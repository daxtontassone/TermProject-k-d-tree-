# TermProject k-d-tree

This code is for a K-dimensional tree, meaning it can have inputs of any k dimensions. To compile this code, it requires two command line arguments. The
first is an input file with points of k dimensions. These points are separated by brackets and a line break. Multiple example inputs have been provided. 
The second command line arugment is the k variable, meaning how many dimensions the points that are being entered are. After these two CLA's are given,
the code can be run. Once run, it will ask you to give it a prompt, which are Insert, Search, Print, and End. Insert will ask you to give it a point to 
insert into the tree. Search will ask for a point to search for, and will return true or false. Print will print the tree for you. And end will end the 
code.
